<article class="faq">
  <h2 id="-zones-of-control" class="" style="" data-heading="1.1"> Zones of Control</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>If a unit finds itself in an enemy zone of control is it obligated to leave it via the shortest possible path?</dt>
  <dd>No, the unit just needs to leave the zone of control before the end of the action.</dd>
  <dt>Can a unit be exactly 5cm away from an enemy unit?</dt>
  <dd>No, the unit must be more than 5cm away from enemy unit, otherwise it would be in the enemy’s zone of control.</dd>
  <dt>If a formation is within an enemy formation’s zone of control can it engage another enemy formation?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, so long as it completely leaves the first enemy formation’s zone of control with the <q>charge</q> move.</dd>
</dl>

<article class="faq">
  <h2 id="-aircraft-attacks" class="" style="" data-heading="1.2"> Aircraft Attacks</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Can an aircraft end its approach move in the middle of an enemy formation in order to ensure a specific target is allocated hits before other models?</dt>
  <dd>No, if an aircraft ends its approach move in this manner then assume the fire is coming from the direction of the approach move.</dd>
  <dt>Do aircraft that attack ground formations suffer to hit modifiers for cover?</dt>
  <dd>Only if the target is in cover, if the target is obscured then no because aircraft ignore anything that might block line of sight.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Are modifiers to an amour save cumulative? For example, does a <em>sniper</em> hit on a unit caught in a crossfire suffer a -2 save modifier?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, all modifiers apply unless specifically stated otherwise.</dd>

  <dd>In other words, if light vehicles are with infantry then allocate <abbr title="Anti-tank">AT</abbr> hits to the light vehicles before <abbr title="Anti-personnel">AP</abbr> hits.

<dl>
  <dt>Can a barrage claim a crossfire bonus?</dt>
  <dd>Yes.</dd>
  <dt>If a unit is under multiple templates from the same barrage how many to hit rolls are rolled for it?</dt>
  <dd>One.</dd>
  <dt>Do extra Barrage templates have to be placed to get as many enemy units from the target formation under them as possible?</dt>
  <dd>The rules are unclear here, but yes they do.</dd>
  <dt>Can a Barrage template be placed over units that can’t be seen? Or over units that are out of range?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, each weapon contributing to the barrage need only have a line of fire and range to a <em>single unit</em> under the <em>first</em> Barrage template. Extra Barrage templates do not require either condition, and an indirect fire barrage does not require a line of fire.</dd>
  <dt>Can a Barrage template be placed completely out of range?</dt>
  <dd>Extra templates certainly can, and the first Barrage template can in certain circumstances (a unit that is partially in and partially out of range for instance). The Barrage template can be placed over any part of a unit (even if that part is out of range) so long as part of that unit is in range. A line of fire is still required to this unit, unless it is an indirect fire barrage.</dd>
  <dt>How do you resolve hits for a Barrage template that’s over some units in cover and some that aren’t?</dt>
  <dd>Roll to hit separately for those units in cover, and for those units not in cover.</dd>
  <dt>How do you resolve hits for a Barrage template that’s over different kinds of units?</dt>
  <dd>Each unit under a template requires a separate to hit roll to see if it has been hit. For example, a barrage covering two Nobz (one with the Warlord), six Boyz (with two in cover), two Grotz, four Battlewagons and one Flakwagon would need to roll the following to hit rolls: one for the Nobz with the Warlord, one for the other Nobz, four for the Boyz out of cover, two for the Boyz in cover, two for the Grotz, four for the Battlewagons and one for the Flakwagon.</dd>
  <dd>The <q>type</q> referred to in the sentence about speed dice rolling refers to the kind of unit (Tactical, Assault, Devastator, etc.) not the unit type (<abbr title="Infantry">INF</abbr>, <abbr title="Armoured Vehicle">AV</abbr>, etc.).</dd>
  <dt>How are barrages where some barrage points have special abilities resolved?</dt>
  <dd>When firing in a barrage, a special weapon ability can only be used if all of the units firing have it. If a special ability is used in a barrage then those barrage weapons that don’t have the special ability may not fire in the barrage, nor may they fire a separate barrage during their activation.</dd>

  <dt>Can a war engine barge a unit and then move away from other units to deny attacks?</dt>

  <dt>How many units does a war engine making a charge move count as when moving into base contact with an enemy unit?</dt>
  <dd>One. A war engine may have a number of units equal to twice its starting damage capacity in base contact with it but it still only counts as one unit when it moves into base contact with another unit (i.e., a Baneblade with a DC of 3 could be contacted by up to six enemy Shadowswords).</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Does the Kashnarak need to pass an action test?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, it has an initiative rating of 2+.</dd>
  <dt>What happens if the Kashnarak fails an action test?</dt>
  <dd>It carries out a hold action and moves as described.</dd>
  <dt>Does the Kashnarak avoid dangerous terrain?</dt>
  <dd>Only if its move is being directed by a Dark Eldar player.</dd>
  <dt>Does the Kashnarak avoid impassable terrain?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, it takes the shortest path around any impassable terrain. If there are multiple shortests paths around the terrain then the player whose formation it is moving towards may choose which path it takes.</dd>
  <dt>Does the Kashnarak avoid overwatch fire?</dt>
  <dd>Only if its move is being directed by a Dark Eldar player.</dd>
  <dt>Can the Kashnarak declare formations as being intermingled?</dt>
  <dd>Only if its move is being directed by a Dark Eldar player. Otherwise, the formations are only considered intermingled if the Kashnarak moves into base contact with each of them.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Can a unit that’s making a charge move put an enemy unit in base contact if the enemy is in terrain that is dangerous to the charging unit?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, if part of the enemy unit is not in dangerous terrain the unit can be put in base contact there without taking a dangerous terrain test. If the enemy unit is completely within the dangerous terrain then the charging unit would have to take a dangerous terrain test.</dd>
  <dt>Can a unit that’s making a charge move put an enemy unit in base contact if the enemy is in terrain that is impassable to the charging unit?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, if part of the enemy unit is not in impassable terrain the unit can be put in base contact there. If the enemy unit is completely within the impassable terrain then no.</dd>
  <dt>What happens to a charging unit that enters the zone of control of an enemy unit and it does not have enough movement to make it into base contact?</dt>
  <dd>The charging unit would move as much as possible towards the closest enemy unit. The intent of the rule is that you should not be able to charge through a zone of control to reach a unit further away but should always move towards the closest enemy unit even if you cannot make it into base contact.</dd>
  <dt>Can a unit making a charge move claim the cover to hit modifier and receive a cover save against overwatch fire?</dt>
  <dd>Yes and yes.</dd>
  <dt>After it makes a charge move does the engaging formation need to have at least one unit with a line of fire to a unit in the target formation in order for the assault to take place?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. While it is not specifically stated in the rules it is implied (<q>close enough that individual infantry are able to engage in the fight and make use of their small arms</q>) and required to resolve firefight attacks.</dd>

  <dt>Can a formation on overwatch use its overwatch fire when it is in the zone of control of an enemy formation.</dt>

  <dt>A formation carries out an action that involves a move but none of the units physically move, is it still susceptible to overwatch?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Any action that includes one of more moves (advance, engage, double, march and possibly marshal, hold and special actions) is considered a move for the purposes of overwatch, even if units moved 0cm.</dd>
  <dd>Note that withdrawals and consolidation moves are optional however, and that a player can choose not to move the formation at all, thus avoiding overwatch.</dd>
  <dt>Do units that enter play via a special rule (landing, planetfall, self planetfall, teleporting, tunneling, being summoned or swarmed) trigger overwatch fire?</dt>

  <dt>How are attacks with special abilities like ignore cover and lance allocated in an assault?</dt>
  <dd>This was never covered in the rules. The unofficial consensus is that they should be allocated in such a way to utilize their special rules, if possible.

  <dt>Can a formation that contains transport units with teleport and transported units without it still teleport in?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, but any units that can’t be transported should be considered destroyed.</dd>
  <dt>Can a unit with teleport and scout teleport onto the board and set up within 20cm from each other?</dt>
  <dd>No, all units after the first need to be placed within 5cms of a unit that has already been placed.</dd>
  <dt>How many D6 should a war engine unit roll when it teleports into play?</dt>

  <h2 id="-terrain-effects" class="" style="" data-heading="1.75"> Terrain Effects</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>How many units can claim cover from a fortification?</dt>
  <dd>If this isn’t covered by special rules or the scenario then it should be brought up in the five minute warm up.</dd>
  <dt>Can a speed 0cm unit on a road claim the +5cm move bonus?</dt>
  <dd>There is no clear distinction in the rules between speed 0cm and immobile units. We recommend you go over it with your opponent during the 5 minute warm-up.</dd>
  <dd>A speed 0cm unit could possibly benefit from the road movement bonus, allowing it to move 5cm per move. However, it may obviously not leave the road as it would then lose its bonus movement. A unit with a speed of <q>immobile</q> may not move, even on a road.</dd>
  <dt>Can units making a counter charge move on a road claim the +5cm move bonus?</dt>
  <dd>No, the <q>moves</q> referenced here are those in actions. A counter charge move is not one of those moves.</dd>
  <dt>How many infantry can be counted as being in cover when touching an armoured vehicle or war engine?</dt>
  <dd>There is no limit as per the written rules, so long as the infantry bases can touch the <abbr title="Armoured Vehicle">AV</abbr> or <abbr title="War Engine">WE</abbr>. However, a limit of 2 per <abbr title="Armoured Vehicle">AV</abbr> (2 per starting DC of a <abbr title="War Engine">WE</abbr>) is an extremely common house rule. Enough so that it should be brought up in the five minute warm up.</dd>
  <dt>Can an infantry unit claim cover from enemy armoured vehicles?</dt>
  <dd>Yes.</dd>

  <dt>What happens to transported units when the unit transporting them is destroyed by ending its second withdrawal move within 15cm of the enemy?</dt>
  <dd>If they’re broken and not <em>fearless</em> they will be destroyed. Otherwise they make their normal armour save or a 6+ cover save.</dd>
  <dt>If a transport is destroyed by a hit with a special ability does that carry over to the transported units?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, the transported units save is affected by the type of hit the transport is destroyed by. For example, an <em>ignore cover</em> hit would prevent the transported units from making a 6+ cover save.</dd>
